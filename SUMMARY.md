# PDF RAG System - Deliverables Summary

This document summarizes the implemented deliverables for the PDF RAG system project.

## 1. Functional RAG System for PDF Question Answering

The system provides a complete solution for answering questions from PDF documents:

- **PDF Processing**: Layout-aware text extraction supporting both single and multi-column layouts
- **Text Chunking**: Smart chunking with configurable size and overlap
- **Embedding Generation**: Vector embeddings using Google's advanced models
- **Vector Storage**: Efficient storage and retrieval using FAISS or ChromaDB
- **Question Answering**: Context-aware responses using Gemini LLMs
- **Source Attribution**: Answers include source file and page references
- **User Interface**: Streamlit-based UI for easy document uploading and querying

## 2. Comprehensive Evaluation Framework

A robust evaluation system has been implemented to assess the RAG system's performance:

### Evaluation Components

- **RAGEvaluator Class**: A comprehensive evaluation module that provides:
  - Retrieval assessment metrics
  - Answer quality metrics
  - Hallucination detection
  - Fluency measurement
  - Report generation

- **Evaluation Script**: A command-line tool (`evaluate_rag.py`) that:
  - Processes ground truth data
  - Runs all evaluation metrics
  - Generates detailed reports
  - Provides configuration options

- **Ground Truth Data**: Sample ground truth file with questions, reference answers, and source information

### Evaluation Metrics

1. **Retrieval Performance**
   - Precision: Accuracy of retrieved documents
   - Recall: Coverage of relevant documents
   - F1 Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall
   - Mean Reciprocal Rank: Position of first relevant document
   - Retrieval Time: Performance measurement

2. **Answer Quality**
   - ROUGE Scores: Overlap between generated and reference answers
   - BLEU Score: Translation quality metric
   - Answer Generation Time: Performance measurement

3. **Factual Accuracy & Hallucination**
   - Factual Accuracy: Proportion of answer supported by context
   - Unsupported Information Ratio: Measure of hallucination

4. **Fluency Assessment**
   - Sentence Length Analysis
   - Word Length Analysis

### Output Formats

- JSON results file with detailed metrics
- Markdown report with metrics and interpretations
- Console summary output for quick assessment

## 3. Architecture Documentation

Comprehensive documentation has been provided to explain the system:

### Architecture Document (`ARCHITECTURE.md`)

- **System Architecture**: Visual representation and explanation of components
- **Component Details**: In-depth description of each module:
  - PDF Processor
  - Text Chunker
  - Embeddings Generator
  - Vector Store
  - LLM Retriever
  - RAG Pipeline
  - RAG Evaluator

- **Data Flow**: Explanation of information flow through the system
- **Configuration Options**: Detailed overview of customization possibilities
- **Performance Considerations**: Analysis of scalability, accuracy, and response time
- **Evaluation Methodology**: Explanation of the evaluation approach
- **Future Enhancements**: Potential improvements and extensions

### Updated README

- Added information about the evaluation framework
- Included instructions for running evaluations
- Added reference to the architecture documentation
- Updated feature list and technology stack

## Meeting the Deliverables

The implementation fulfills all required deliverables:

1. ✅ **Functional RAG System**: The system successfully processes PDFs and answers questions with source attribution

2. ✅ **Comprehensive Evaluation**: The evaluation framework provides detailed metrics for:
   - Accuracy (retrieval precision, answer quality)
   - Relevance (recall, MRR, ROUGE scores)
   - Fluency (sentence structure, word usage)

3. ✅ **Documentation**: Detailed architecture documentation explains:
   - System components and relationships
   - Data flow and processing pipeline
   - Evaluation methodology
   - Technical implementation details

## Conclusion

The PDF RAG system now provides a complete solution that not only answers questions from PDF documents but also evaluates its own performance and is thoroughly documented. The system is ready for deployment and further customization as needed.
